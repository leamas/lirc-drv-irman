IrMan input driver using libirman.
==================================

This driver supports reading from IrMan devices. This device [2] is
discontinued and not available any more. However, the protocol
used by it is emulated by other hardware, notably the IrToy.

The driver expects a tty device as --device argument.

Note that libirman contains test tools. Refer to the libirman
documentation [ยก] \(if you have installed a libirman package
it's likely to contain these documents).


Dependencies
------------

Building this driver requires lirc v 0.9.3+. You need the header files,
the unversioned dynamic libraries and the pkg-config support (.pc
filed). Typically, this lives in a package called lirc-devel.

The build also requires the libirman library [1]. This is packaged
in some distributions. It's a requirement that the package contains a
dynamic .so module. Not all packages do, though. The package is easy
to build and install locally if need be.


Build, install and check
------------------------

With dependencies in place the build is trivial:

    $ make
    $ sudo make install

The makefile respects CFLAGS and LDFLAGS if they are set in the environment
during the build.

After the installation, check the results using lirc-lsplugins:

    $ lirc-lsplugins irman
    irman               ---   /usr/lib64/lirc/plugins/irman_drv.so


Adding the *--long* option gives more info on the driver.
